The provided list of songs has a relatively high average danceability of 0.71.
At the same time, both energy and valence are at moderate levels, around the midpoint of the scale:
a bit more energy (average 0.65) than valence (average 0.48). To translate these numbers into colors,
we need to understand a bit about the meaning of colors in culture. Purple is often seen as majestic,
blue as serene, and yellow brings to mind sunny times and happiness. Based on the provided data,
I could assume that the listener enjoys happy music without any overly dramatic mood,
so the colors could be yellow and pink.

To be more precise, I would create two equations (in collaboration with Mystic Michaela)
that require these three factors as variables.
 These equations would provide us with some grades that we could match to specific color representations.
